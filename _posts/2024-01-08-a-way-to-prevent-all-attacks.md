Cyber attacks are a growing concern for individuals and organizations alike. According to a recent report by Statista, ransomware was the most frequently detected cyberattack worldwide in 2022, accounting for around 68% of all detected cyberattacks. Network breaches ranked second, with over 18% of the detections. Although less frequently, data exfiltration was also among the detected cyber attacks. [1]

In 2022, there were 236.1 million ransomware attacks worldwide, despite a 235% decrease in global ransomware attacks [2]. In the same year, bulk phishing attacks were the most common cyber incidents experienced by 85% of organizations, followed by spear phishing, with three in four respondents stating having encountered such incidents during the same year [3].

The impact of cyber attacks can be devastating. For example, the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 caused an estimated $10 billion in damages [4]. The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 affected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries, causing billions of dollars in damages [2].
