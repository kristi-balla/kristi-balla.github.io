Hello, World!

My name's Kristi and I am a Computer Science Student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and a Cyber Security enthusiast!

I enjoy spending my free time on different projects, trying to deepen the knowledge from the lectures. My main fields of interest consist of identity leakage, credential protection, privacy enhancing technologies as well as developing secure software and analyzing software vulnerabilities. Furthermore I am interested in networking and securing the communication through a shared network.
